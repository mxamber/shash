# shash

Consider the following scenario: a person only has a very rudimentary idea of how hashing algorithms work, but wants to code their own. The start writing stuff until it works, even though they have no idea how to test whether the algorithm works without hash collisions.

This is how shash came to be. So far I haven't found any two strings that result in identical hashes. Take a good look at the code, have a laugh at my expense, look elsewhere.
